# What is a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)?

A Virtual Private Cloud is an isolated private cloud located within a public cloud which separates a user's resources from others within the same network. A customer can use a VPC to do many things including (but not limited to): hosting websites, running code and storing data.

## How does a VPC work?
Through the allocation of private IP subnet and a virtual communication construct such as a VLAN or a set of encrypted communication channels per user, the isolation between one VPC user and their resources and all other users within the same public cloud can be achieved.
- **Subnets**: This is a network within another network which makes transferring data more efficient by causing network traffic travel shorter distances without passing through unnecessary routers to reach its destination. It is made up of a range of IP addresses within a network to be able to divide a part of it for private use. In a VPC private IP addresses are used that are not accessible via the public internet.
